# Space Cruise is a text based adventure game made with python and sql, created by Paavo Helin(me) and Ilias Doukas.
This project was for the course "Pelit ja mobiilit"(Games and mobile) at Metropolia, University of applied sciences.

# *Notice* 
This project was done as a group, and I can not take full credit for it. But the all the code was made pretty evenly 50/50
